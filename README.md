# Rewinder

Rewinder is a web app that finds you an interesting route for your next walk or run. 
Given a starting location and a desired distance, Rewinder finds a route optimized to include the maximum number of sites of interest (buildings registered in the [National Register of Historic Places](https://www.nps.gov/nr/) and [Yelp's "Local Flavor" locations](https://www.yelp.com/c/sf/localflavor)).

I developed this project as a post-doctoral fellow in the [Insight Data Science program](https://www.insightdatascience.com/) in 2014. Please note that I have since learned a lot about documentation, code quality, testing, and logging that is not reflected in this repository!
